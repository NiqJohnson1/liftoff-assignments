# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I'm creating a student record system that holds student information for classes and personal student data (name, student ID, year, and email). In order for a student to return to campus, they must be vaccinated. I want to add a vaccine column that will display YES or NO to a student being vaccinated or not. If a student has received the vaccine, the system approves their class syllabus. Otherwise a "hold screen" will remain on the student's account until vaccine documentation has been received.
### Features
A user will be able to login to access the portal. 
	Student Login Module
	Admin Login Module
	Search Feature - Admin accounts can search for students info
	Upload document - PDF

### Technologies
Java
Spring 
MySQL
IntelliJ
Hibernate
ThymeLeaf Templates

### What I'll Have to Learn
I want to be able to create an upload feature for the vaccine column. A student should be able to upload their vaccination document to their profile which will be updated on the admin side.
